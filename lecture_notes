	Basic Local Alignment Search Tool

NCBI Blast
	* 
BLAST+ 3.0..
	* cpp version
probability close to 0 means this is the only strong alignment
	- strong matching
*Execution Flow of NCBI Blast
HSP - high scoring pairs
10^-5 => seriously aligned in the real world
	* good matching
*Smith-Waterman
	*
*Heuristics: seeding
	* assumption: significant aligments have words in common
	*Seed=3 => 3 bases
	*Protein-seed = 3
	*DNA seed = 11
	*two-hit-distance: 
*Heuristics: extension
	* 
BLOSOM62 score matrix
	- 62 - more than 62% similar => combined into the same protein sequence
*Evaluation
	* Evalue = K * m' * n' * exp^(-lambda*s)
	*Gapped-alignment: single Evalue
	* ungapped-alignment: multiple evalues
* 1 database sequence can provide multiple alignments
* Blast program -flag options
	-num_descriptions 1000
	-num_alignments 800
*smith-waterman
	* search entire search space no heuristic
