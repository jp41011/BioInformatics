Steps after the prep
1. ./bowtie-build chr1_masked_1.fa CHR1_7
- which was the output from task1
- which will be our bowtie DB
2. ./bowtie -m 1 -v 3 CHR1_7 ERR030893-1.fq > BTout_m1_v3
- run bowtie with our output as the DB and the given file as the query file
3. Now have to remove some columns from BTout_m1_v3
- used ReqEx to remove the ...length=75... and replace with \t
- used " length=\d*\t" and replaced with "\t"
3.1 also have to fill in the space after the first space in each line to combine it into one column
- used ReqEx "^\w*\.\d*" and replaced the space that follow that ReqEx with "_"
4. now have to do the gene and exon counting
